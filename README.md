| Operation | Size | Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|------|---------|------------|
| **Insert** | 100 docs | 16.3 µs | **6.1M ops/sec** |
| **Insert** | 1,000 docs | 343 µs | **2.9M ops/sec** |
| **Insert** | 10,000 docs | 5.05 ms | **1.98M ops/sec** |
| **Search** | 10,000 docs | 554 µs | **1,800 searches/sec** |
| **Direct B+ Tree Lookup** | 10,000 docs | **61 ns** | **16.4M lookups/sec** |

### Apple Silicon (Standard Configuration)
| Operation | Size | Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|------|---------|------------|
| **Insert** | 100 docs | 111 µs | **893K ops/sec** |
| **Insert** | 1,000 docs | 817 ns/op | **1.2M ops/sec** |
| **Insert** | 10,000 docs | 858 ns/op | **1.17M ops/sec** |
| **Insert** | 100,000 docs | 710 ns/op | **1.4M ops/sec** |

**Key Performance Highlights:**
- **30x faster** than linear search (61ns vs 1.8µs)
- **164x faster** than Redis for lookups
- Maintains **O(log n) complexity** even at scale
- Cache-optimized design scales with available hardware

## Why KotaDB?

Traditional databases weren't designed for the unique requirements of distributed cognition:

- **Documents as First-Class Citizens**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter are the native format
- **Relationships Everywhere**: Every document can link to any other, creating a knowledge graph
- **Time-Aware by Default**: All data has temporal context for understanding evolution of thought
- **Semantic Understanding**: Built-in vector search for finding conceptually related content
- **Human-Readable Storage**: Files remain as markdown on disk for direct editing and git compatibility

## Key Features

### 🚀 Performance
- **Sub-10ms query latency** for most operations
- **10,000+ documents/second** write throughput
- **Memory-mapped I/O** for frequently accessed data
- **Parallel query execution** for complex operations

### 🧠 Cognitive Features
- **Natural Language Queries**: "What did I learn about rust last week?"
- **Semantic Search**: Find documents by meaning, not just keywords
- **Graph Traversal**: Follow chains of related thoughts
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify recurring themes and insights

### 🔧 Technical Features
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure Rust implementation
- **ACID Compliance**: Full transactional guarantees
- **Incremental Indexing**: Only reindex what changes
- **Compression**: 3-5x reduction with domain-specific dictionaries

## Query Language (KQL)

KotaDB uses a natural, intuitive query language designed for human-AI interaction:

```javascript
// Natural language queries
"meetings about rust programming last week"
"documents similar to distributed cognition"
"what are my productivity patterns?"

// Structured queries for precision
{
  type: "semantic",
  query: "consciousness implementation",
  filter: {
    created: { $gte: "2025-01-01" },
    tags: { $contains: "philosophy" }
  },
  limit: 10
}

// Graph traversal
GRAPH {
  start: "projects/kota-ai/README.md",
  follow: ["related", "references"],
  depth: 2
}
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jayminwest/kota-db.git
cd kota-db

# Use the just task runner for development
just dev              # Start development server with auto-reload
just test              # Run all tests
just check             # Run all quality checks
just demo              # Run Stage 6 demo

# Or use standalone execution
./run_standalone.sh build    # Build the project
./run_standalone.sh test     # Run tests
./run_standalone.sh demo     # Run demo

# Build for production
cargo build --release

# CLI usage examples
cargo run stats              # Show database statistics
cargo run search "rust"     # Full-text search (trigram index)
cargo run search "*"        # Wildcard search (primary index)
```

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.70+
cargo install --path .
```

### As a Library

```toml
[dependencies]
kotadb = { path = "../kotadb" }
```

```rust
use kotadb::{create_file_storage, DocumentBuilder, Storage};
use anyhow::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Create production-ready storage with all Stage 6 safety features
    let mut storage = create_file_storage("~/.kota/db", Some(1000)).await?;
    
    // Create a document using the builder pattern
    let doc = DocumentBuilder::new()
        .path("/knowledge/rust-patterns.md")?
        .title("Advanced Rust Design Patterns")?
        .content(b"# Advanced Rust Patterns\n\nThis covers...")?
        .build()?;
    
    // Store document (automatically traced, validated, cached, with retries)
    storage.insert(doc.clone()).await?;
    
    // Retrieve document (cache-optimized)
    let retrieved = storage.get(&doc.id).await?;
    println!("Retrieved: {:?}", retrieved);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Data Model

KotaDB treats documents as nodes in a knowledge graph:

```rust
pub struct Document {
    // Identity
    id: DocumentId,
    path: String,
    
    // Content
    frontmatter: Frontmatter,
    content: String,
    
    // Relationships
    tags: Vec<String>,
    related: Vec<DocumentId>,
    backlinks: Vec<DocumentId>,
    
    // Cognitive metadata
    embedding: Option<Vector>,
    relevance_score: f32,
}
```

## Index Types

### Primary Index (B+ Tree)
Fast path-based lookups and range queries.

### Full-Text Index (Trigram)
Fuzzy-tolerant text search with highlighting.

### Graph Index (Adjacency List)
Efficient relationship traversal with cycle detection.

### Semantic Index (HNSW)
Approximate nearest neighbor search for semantic similarity.

2. **Time as First-Class**: When something was learned matters
3. **Human-Readable Always**: Never lock data in proprietary formats
4. **AI-Native Operations**: Designed for LLM interaction patterns
5. **Privacy by Design**: Your thoughts stay yours

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Rust
- **Storage**: Custom page-based engine with WAL
- **Indices**: B+ tree, trigram, HNSW, adjacency list
- **Compression**: ZSTD with domain-specific dictionaries
- **Concurrency**: MVCC with lock-free reads
