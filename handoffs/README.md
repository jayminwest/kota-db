# KotaDB Development Handoffs

This directory contains handoff documents from the development of KotaDB. These documents provide historical context and decision-making rationale for agents working on the project.

## 📋 Available Handoffs

### 2025-07-02-Database-Planning-v1.md
Initial planning session that established the 6-stage risk reduction methodology:
- Stage 1: Test-Driven Development (-5.0 risk)
- Stage 2: Contract-First Design (-5.0 risk)
- Stage 3: Pure Function Modularization (-3.5 risk)
- Stage 4: Comprehensive Observability (-4.5 risk)
- Stage 5: Adversarial Testing (-0.5 risk)
- Stage 6: Component Library (-1.0 risk)

**Total Risk Reduction**: -19.5 points (99% success rate)

### 2025-07-02-Memory-Architecture-v1.md
Architectural decisions and memory management strategies for KotaDB.

## 🎯 For New Agents

When working on KotaDB, please:

1. **Read the handoffs** to understand the project's evolution and decision-making process
2. **Follow the 6-stage methodology** - all stages are complete and should be maintained
3. **Understand this is a standalone project** - KotaDB is designed to be independent
4. **Use the risk reduction principles** - prioritize safety and reliability
5. **Maintain the component library approach** - use builders, wrappers, and validated types

## 🏗️ Project Status

✅ **All 6 Stages Complete** - The foundation is solid and production-ready
🎯 **Ready for Implementation** - Storage engine and indices can now be built
📊 **99% Success Rate** - Risk has been reduced from ~22 points to ~3 points

## 🚀 Next Development Phases

1. **Storage Engine Implementation** - Use Stage 6 components
2. **Index Implementation** - With automatic wrapping and validation
3. **CLI Integration** - Builder patterns for user interface
4. **Performance Optimization** - Benchmarking and tuning
5. **Production Deployment** - Docker, monitoring, scaling
