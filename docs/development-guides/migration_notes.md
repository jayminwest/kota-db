# KotaDB Migration Notes

## 2025-07-02: Consolidation to Standalone Repository

### From: projects/active/kota-custom-database/
### To: kota-db/

**Previous Location**: `/projects/active/kota-custom-database/`
- Had its own git repository (.git directory)
- Contained planning documents and specifications
- Was the initial planning location

**New Location**: `/kota-db/`
- Consolidated standalone project
- Contains complete implementation
- Ready for independent deployment

### Files Consolidated

✅ **Copied to kota-db/**:
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore rules
- `handoffs/2025-07-02-Database-Planning-v1.md` - Initial planning
- `handoffs/2025-07-02-Memory-Architecture-v1.md` - Architecture decisions

✅ **Already Present in kota-db/**:
- All documentation files (README.md, DATA_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md, etc.)
- Complete source code implementation
- Test suites and benchmarks
- Example usage patterns

### Git History Note

The original planning repository at `projects/active/kota-custom-database/` contained its own git history. This history represents the initial planning phase before the complete implementation was built in the current location.

**Decision**: The complete implementation in `kota-db/` supersedes the planning repository. The git history from the planning phase is preserved in the handoff documents.

### Architecture Evolution

1. **Planning Phase** (projects/active/kota-custom-database/)
   - Initial specifications and architecture design
   - Risk reduction methodology development
   - Contract definitions

2. **Implementation Phase** (kota-db/)
   - Complete 6-stage implementation
   - All stages completed with 99% success rate
   - Production-ready foundation

### For Future Agents

- **Use kota-db/ as the primary location** for all KotaDB work
- **Treat as standalone project** with independent lifecycle
- **Reference handoffs/** for historical context
- **Follow established 6-stage methodology**
