## Key Architectural Principles

KotaDB is built with a 6-stage risk reduction methodology:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage
2. **Contract-First Design**: Clear interfaces and contracts  
3. **Pure Function Modularization**: Functional programming principles
4. **Comprehensive Observability**: Built-in monitoring and tracing
5. **Adversarial Testing**: Chaos testing and edge case coverage
6. **Component Library Usage**: Reusable, validated components
