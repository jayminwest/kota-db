# KotaDB Planning Overview

This directory contains comprehensive planning documents for KotaDB, a custom database designed for distributed human-AI cognition.

## Planning Documents

1. **[IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - Complete 13-week implementation roadmap
2. **[TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Detailed system architecture and design
3. **[DATA_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md](DATA_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Storage formats, index structures, and compression schemes
4. **[QUERY_LANGUAGE_DESIGN.md](QUERY_LANGUAGE_DESIGN.md)** - KQL (KOTA Query Language) specification
5. **[MVP_SPECIFICATION.md](MVP_SPECIFICATION.md)** - 3-week MVP plan for immediate value

## Key Decisions

- **Storage**: Keep markdown files as source of truth, database stores metadata/indices only
- **Architecture**: Hybrid document/graph/vector database optimized for cognitive workloads
- **Query Language**: Natural language first with structured fallback
- **Implementation**: MVP in 3 weeks, full system in 13 weeks

## Background

This project emerged from recognizing that narrative-based memory systems are fundamentally flawed for AI. Instead, KotaDB implements a dynamic model with:

- Documents as nodes in a knowledge graph
- Time as a first-class dimension
- Semantic understanding built-in
- Human-readable storage always maintained
