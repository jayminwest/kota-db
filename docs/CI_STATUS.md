# CI/CD Pipeline Status

This document tracks the current status of our CI/CD pipeline after recent optimizations.

## âœ… Recent Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel Execution**: Jobs that don't depend on each other now run in parallel
- **Better Caching**: Using `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` for intelligent Rust dependency caching
- **Fail-Fast**: Format checks run first and fail quickly if code isn't formatted
- **Reduced Test Threads**: Prevents resource contention in CI environment

### Fixed Issues
1. **Docker Build**: Added missing `storage_stress.rs` benchmark file
2. **Security Audit**: Updated `slab` crate from 0.4.10 to 0.4.11 to fix vulnerability
3. **Code Coverage**: Made codecov upload optional with `continue-on-error`
4. **Branch Protection**: Added required "Build and Test" and "Clippy" job names

## Current CI Jobs

| Job | Purpose | Dependencies | Expected Time |
|-----|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Format Check | Verify code formatting | None | ~30s |
| Clippy | Linting with all warnings as errors | None | ~1-2min |
| Build and Test | Main test suite (required) | None | ~2-3min |
| Test Matrix | Beta/Nightly testing | Format, Clippy | ~2-3min |
| Security Audit | Check for vulnerabilities | None | ~1min |
| Integration Tests | Run integration test suite | Format | ~2-3min |
| Performance Tests | Performance regression tests | Format | ~2-3min |
| Container Build | Build Docker image | None | ~2-3min |
| Documentation | Build Rust docs | None | ~1-2min |
| Code Coverage | Generate coverage report | Build and Test | ~2-3min |

## Expected Total CI Time
With parallel execution: **~3-5 minutes** (down from 10+ minutes)

## Monitoring
- All checks should pass on this PR
- Required checks: "Build and Test" and "Clippy" must pass for merge
- Optional checks: Code Coverage may show as skipped if token isn't available
