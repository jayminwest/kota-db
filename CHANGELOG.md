## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `--verbose` flag for CLI operations to enable detailed logging output (#335)
  - Default logging level set to WARN for clean agent-friendly output
  - Use `--verbose` or `-v` to enable INFO level logging for progress visibility
  - RUST_LOG environment variable still overrides all settings for debugging

  - Allows limiting the number of results returned for better readability
  - Prevents overwhelming output when analyzing symbols with many dependencies
- Binary trigram index implementation for high-performance search (#311)
  - New `--binary-index` flag enables 10x faster index operations
  - Uses bincode serialization instead of JSON for compact storage
  - Implements memory-mapped file access for zero-copy operations

### Fixed
- Edge metadata update and removal operations for multiple edge support (#332)

  - Changed default logging level from DEBUG to WARN for cleaner output
  - Eliminated excessive trace output that buried useful information

  - Fixed routing of wildcard queries (e.g., "*.rs", "*Controller.rs") to primary index
  - Implemented proper glob pattern matching for path-based searches
  - Wildcard patterns now correctly filter results based on file paths
- Symbol storage directory not being created automatically (#272)
  - Added automatic directory creation when accessing symbol storage
  - Fixed issue where symbol-stats and relationship commands would fail on first use
  - Symbol storage paths are now created lazily when needed
- Missing CLI commands for symbol analysis (#271)
  - Enabled tree-sitter-parsing feature by default
  - Made symbol-stats, find-callers, impact-analysis commands available by default
  - Commands were previously hidden behind feature flag
- Improved documentation for ingest-repo command flags (#273)
  - Added clearer documentation for --extract-symbols and --no-symbols flags
  - Made symbol extraction enabled by default with tree-sitter feature
  - Improved help text to explain flag usage
- Over-aggressive query sanitization breaking path searches (#275)
  - Added path-aware query sanitization that preserves forward slashes
  - Fixed issue where path-based searches were failing due to slash removal
  - Automatically detects path queries and applies appropriate sanitization
- Critical index synchronization failure during repository ingestion (#248)
  - Fixed validation false positive showing primary index limited to 1000 documents
    - Increased query limits from 1000 to 100,000 throughout the codebase
    - Updated ValidationConfig defaults to handle larger repositories
  - Fixed trigram index returning 0 documents for wildcard queries
    - Added support for wildcard queries (empty search terms) in trigram index
    - Trigram index now returns all indexed documents for validation queries
  - Added comprehensive test suite to reproduce and validate the fixes
  - This resolves issues where search validation failed for repositories with >1000 documents
- Critical trigram index bug where insert() method was not indexing actual document content (#249)
  - Changed insert() to return error directing users to insert_with_content()
  - Fixed unit test to use insert_with_content() for proper content indexing
  - Added comprehensive test to validate the error behavior
  - This fixes full-text search which was completely broken due to placeholder indexing

### Security
