# Architecture Review Meeting - August 7, 2025

**Attendees**: Development team, stakeholders
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Status**: KotaDB production readiness assessment

## Key Decisions

### âœ… Production Readiness Confirmed
- All 195+ tests passing
- Zero clippy warnings with strict linting
- Performance targets met (sub-10ms queries)
- Complete observability implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Next Priority: Examples & Validation
