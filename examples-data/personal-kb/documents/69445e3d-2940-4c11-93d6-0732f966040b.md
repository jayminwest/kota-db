# Performance Optimization Techniques

## Database Performance

### Indexing Strategies
- **Covering Indices**: Include all query columns
- **Partial Indices**: Index subset of rows
- **Composite Indices**: Multi-column optimization
- **Function-Based Indices**: Index computed values

### Query Optimization
- Use EXPLAIN to understand query plans
- Avoid SELECT * in production queries
- Use appropriate WHERE clause ordering
- Consider query result caching

### Storage Optimization
- **Partitioning**: Split large tables
- **Compression**: Reduce I/O overhead
- **Memory Mapping**: Efficient file access
- **Write-Ahead Logging**: Crash recovery

## Application Performance

### Memory Management
- Pool expensive resources
- Use appropriate data structures
- Monitor garbage collection patterns
- Implement backpressure mechanisms

### Concurrency
- Lock-free data structures where possible
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Consider work-stealing thread pools
- Profile contention points

## KotaDB Optimizations
- Memory-mapped file access
- Intelligent index selection
- Batch operations for bulk work
- Component composition for efficiency
- Zero-copy operations where possible

## Monitoring
- Track key performance indicators
- Set up alerting for performance degradation
- Use distributed tracing for complex workflows
- Profile production workloads regularly
