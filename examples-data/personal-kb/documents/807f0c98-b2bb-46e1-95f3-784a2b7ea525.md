# Distributed Systems Fundamentals

Understanding how to build reliable systems across multiple machines.

## CAP Theorem
You can only guarantee 2 out of 3:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- **Availability**: System remains operational
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues despite network failures

## Consensus Algorithms
- **Raft**: Leader-based consensus with log replication
- **PBFT**: Byzantine fault tolerant consensus
- **Paxos**: Classical consensus (complex but foundational)

## Patterns
- **Event Sourcing**: Store events, not state
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transactions
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fail fast pattern

## Real-World Examples
- Cassandra: AP system (eventually consistent)
- PostgreSQL: CP system (strong consistency)
- DNS: AP system (availability over consistency)
