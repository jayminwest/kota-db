## Abstract
We present a machine learning approach to database query optimization that learns from past query execution patterns to predict optimal execution plans. Our method achieves 15-30% performance improvements over traditional cost-based optimizers.

## Key Findings
1. Neural networks can effectively predict query execution costs
2. Historical execution data provides valuable optimization signals
3. Adaptive learning improves performance over time
4. Works particularly well for complex analytical queries

## Technical Approach
- **Model**: Deep neural network with attention mechanism
- **Features**: Query structure, table statistics, index information
- **Training**: Online learning from query execution feedback
- **Integration**: Replaces cost model in PostgreSQL optimizer

## Experimental Results
- **Datasets**: TPC-H, TPC-DS, real production workloads
- **Improvement**: 15-30% reduction in query execution time
- **Overhead**: <5% optimization time increase
- **Adaptability**: Continues improving with more data

## Personal Notes
- Highly relevant to my thesis on adaptive database systems
- Could apply similar techniques to index selection
- Need to understand attention mechanism details
- Potential collaboration opportunity with database systems lab

## Questions for Authors
- How does the model handle novel query patterns?
- What happens when underlying data distribution changes?
- Can this approach work for transactional workloads?
