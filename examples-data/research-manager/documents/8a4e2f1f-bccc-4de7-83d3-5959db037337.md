# Consensus Algorithms Comparison Matrix

## Overview
Detailed comparison of major consensus algorithms for my dissertation chapter on distributed coordination.

## Comparison Matrix

| Algorithm | Failure Model | Messages per Decision | Latency | Complexity | Production Use |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|---------|------------|----------------|
| Paxos | Crash | 2 phases, 4+ msgs | 2 RTT | High | Google (Chubby) |
| Raft | Crash | 2+ msgs | 1 RTT | Medium | etcd, Consul |
| PBFT | Byzantine | O(n²) msgs | 3 phases | Very High | Hyperledger Fabric |
| HotStuff | Byzantine | O(n) msgs | 3 phases | High | Meta Diem |
| Tendermint | Byzantine | O(n²) msgs | Variable | High | Cosmos |

## Key Insights

### Paxos Family
- **Classic Paxos**: Theoretically elegant but complex to implement
- **Multi-Paxos**: More practical with leader optimization
- **Fast Paxos**: Reduces latency but increases message complexity
- **Vertical Paxos**: Handles configuration changes

### Raft Advantages
- Understandable algorithm design
- Strong leader model simplifies reasoning
- Excellent tooling and implementations
- Good performance for most use cases

### Byzantine Algorithms
- PBFT: First practical BFT algorithm
- HotStuff: Linear communication complexity
- Tendermint: Practical blockchain consensus
- FLP impossibility theorem implications

## Research Questions
1. Can we combine Raft's simplicity with Byzantine fault tolerance?
2. How do these algorithms perform in edge computing scenarios?
3. What are the implications for partial synchrony assumptions?

## Implementation Notes
- etcd (Raft): Production-ready, well-tested
- Consul (Raft): Good for service discovery use cases
- Chubby (Paxos): Google's lock service
- Hyperledger (PBFT): Permissioned blockchain networks

## Future Work
- Implement simplified BFT variant
- Performance analysis in edge environments
- Formal verification of safety properties
