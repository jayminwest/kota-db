# Distributed Consensus Algorithms: A Comprehensive Survey

**Authors**: Smith, J., Johnson, A., Brown, M.

## Abstract
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of distributed consensus algorithms, from classical Paxos to modern Raft and beyond. We analyze theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and performance characteristics across different failure models.

## Key Contributions
1. Taxonomy of consensus algorithms by failure model
2. Performance comparison under various network conditions  
3. Implementation complexity analysis
4. Future research directions

## Notes
- Excellent overview of Raft vs Paxos trade-offs
- Good performance data for network partition scenarios
- Missing coverage of Byzantine fault tolerant algorithms
- Useful for understanding consensus landscape

## Citations in My Work
- Used in Chapter 3 of dissertation for consensus background
- Referenced in paper on "Consensus in Edge Computing Environments"
- Helpful for understanding CAP theorem implications

## Keywords
