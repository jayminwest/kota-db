# Architecture Review - Real-time Collaboration - August 15, 2025

**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Time**: 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM  
**Type**: Architecture Review  
**Project**: Real-time Collaboration Features  
**Participants**: Bob (Tech Lead), Sarah (Architect), Mike (Senior Dev), Carol (UX), Dave (DevOps)

## Review Scope
Comprehensive architecture review for real-time collaborative editing feature scheduled for Q4 2025 release.

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Components
1. **WebSocket Gateway**: Real-time connection management
2. **Operational Transform Engine**: Conflict resolution
3. **Document State Service**: Centralized document management
4. **Presence Service**: User cursor and selection tracking

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io
- **Real-time Engine**: Custom operational transformation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis for caching
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event streaming

## Technical Decisions

### âœ… Approved Decisions
1. **Overall Architecture**: Microservices with OT approach
2. **Technology Stack**: Node.js + Rust + PostgreSQL + Redis
3. **Timeline**: 4-month implementation schedule
4. **Team Assignment**: Bob as technical lead, 4-person dev team

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Decisions
- Third-party library selection (ShareJS vs custom implementation)
- Geographic replication strategy and regions
- Beta testing program scope and timeline

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1)
- Set up development environment
- Implement basic WebSocket connectivity
- Create document data model
- Basic conflict resolution prototype

### Phase 2: Core Features (Month 2)
- Operational transformation implementation
- Multi-user editing functionality
- Presence indicators and user cursors
- Basic version history

### Phase 3: Performance & Scale (Month 3)
- Performance optimization
- Load testing and tuning
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Security hardening

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Month 4)
- Beta testing with select customers
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Documentation and training materials
- Production deployment

## Success Metrics
- **Latency**: <100ms operation acknowledgment
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Adoption**: 50% of active users try feature within 30 days
- **Satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 user rating

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical**: Real-time systems complexity
- **Timeline**: Aggressive 4-month schedule
- **Team Capacity**: Limited experience with real-time systems

## Action Items
- [ ] **Bob**: Finalize technical specification document
- [ ] **Sarah**: Security review of proposed architecture
- [ ] **Mike**: Resource allocation and team assignments
- [ ] **Carol**: UX wireframes for collaborative editing

## Next Steps
- Weekly technical check-ins starting August 22
- Architecture review meeting scheduled for August 27
- Customer beta program planning session August 30
