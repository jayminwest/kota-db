# Dogfooding Round 2: Progress Check After Fixes

## Test Date: August 28, 2024
## Previous Test: August 27, 2024

## Executive Summary

Some critical issues have been addressed, but the most important one (logging verbosity) remains broken, making KotaDB still unusable for LLM context reduction.

## Status of Previously Identified Issues

### üî¥ Issue #367: Excessive Logging Verbosity
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED (Created new issue #380)
- `--quiet` flag was added to CLI
- Implementation exists in `src/observability.rs`
- **BUT IT DOESN'T WORK** - Still produces thousands of lines of output
- Repository ingestion with `--quiet` still generates 22,000+ lines
- This is the #1 blocker for LLM usage

### üî¥ Issue #368: Trigram Index Not Populated
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNCLEAR
- Search now returns results, suggesting trigram might be working
- But validation still fails during ingestion
- Need to verify if this is truly fixed

### üî¥ Issue #369: Natural Language Query Parser
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED!
- `relationship-query "who uses FileStorage?"` now works
- Returns results (though 0 relationships found)
- Parser accepts documented patterns correctly

### üü° Issue #370: Add Code Snippets to Search Results
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED!
- Search now returns code snippets with context
- Shows ellipsis for truncated content
- Has "Run with --context=full for all results" option
- Major improvement for usability

### üü° Issue #371: Wildcard Path Patterns
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FIXED
- `search "*.rs"` works - returns results
- Need to test `search "src/*.rs"` pattern

### üü° Issue #372: Symbol-stats Shows 0
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED
- Still shows "Total symbols: 0" 
- Binary symbols ARE extracted (20,880 found)
- Disconnect between binary storage and stats reporting remains

### üü° Issue #373: Dependency Graph Not Built
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED
- Still not built automatically during ingestion
- Relationship queries find 0 relationships

## New Improvements Found

### ‚úÖ Search with Snippets
The search functionality now provides contextual snippets, which is a HUGE improvement:
```
src/main.rs:881-887
  let cli = Cli::parse();
  
  // Initialize logging with appropriate level based on verbose/quiet flags
  let _ = init_logging_with_level(cli.verbose, cli.quiet);
  ...
```

### ‚úÖ Natural Language Queries Work
The parser now accepts queries like "who uses FileStorage?" correctly.

### ‚úÖ LLM-Optimized Search
New `llm_search.rs` module provides search optimized for LLM consumption.

## Critical Remaining Issues for Sept 10 Launch

### Priority 1: Fix --quiet Flag (#380)
- Implementation exists but doesn't suppress output
- Blocks ALL LLM usage scenarios
- Must be fixed immediately

### Priority 2: Verify Trigram Index (#368)
- Search works but validation fails
- Need to confirm if actually fixed

### Priority 3: Symbol Stats (#372)
- Confusing that stats show 0 when symbols exist
- Lower priority but hurts confidence

## Progress Score: 3/7 Fixed

‚úÖ Natural Language Parser (#369)
‚úÖ Code Snippets (#370)
‚úÖ Basic Search Functionality

‚ùå Logging Verbosity (#367/#380) - CRITICAL
‚ùå Symbol Stats (#372)
‚ùå Dependency Graph (#373)
‚ö†Ô∏è Trigram Index (#368) - Unclear

## Verdict for LLM Usage

**STILL NOT USABLE** due to logging verbosity. Once the `--quiet` flag actually works, KotaDB would become immediately valuable because:
- Search returns useful snippets
- Natural language queries work
- Performance is good

But without fixing #380, it remains counterproductive for context reduction.

## Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **FIX #380 TODAY** - The quiet flag must actually suppress output
2. Test with real Claude Code integration once quiet works
3. Verify trigram index is truly fixed
4. Consider making symbol-stats read from binary symbols

The foundation improvements are excellent (snippets, NL queries), but they're invisible behind the wall of verbose logging.
